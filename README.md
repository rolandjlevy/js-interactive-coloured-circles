# ⚪🔴🔵 Interactive Circles 🔵🔴⚪

A cool grid of interactive coloured circles that change size and opacity based on the position of the cursor.

### Features 💡
- Made with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- Adjusts the size and opacity of each circle by calculating the distance between the circle and the cursor using pythagoras theorem: `Math.sqrt((x * x) + (y * y))` 
- Generates 216 circles each with a unique hex colour
- Doesn't acheive anything - it's just a bit of fun! 😆
