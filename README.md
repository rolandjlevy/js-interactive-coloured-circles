# ⚪🔴🔵 Interactive Circles 🔵🔴⚪

A cool grid of interactive coloured circles that change size and opacity based on the position of the cursor. Simply move your cursor over the grid to see the effect.

### Features 💡
- Generates 216 circles each with a unique hex colour
- The size and opacity of each circle is based on the distance between the circle and the cursor using [pythagoras theorem](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3g9q6f/revision/3), like this: `Math.sqrt((x * x) + (y * y))` 
- Includes dark mode 🌖 ← → 🌒
- Made with Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
- This doesn't achieve anything - it's just a bit of fun! 😆
